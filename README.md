👋 Hi, I’m Davide!

- I am currently finishing my Bachelor's Degree in International Economics and Management at Bocconi University, in Milan 🇮🇹.

- My primary interest is basketball (NBA - Go Warriors!)🏀, and am also passionate about computer programming (R, Python): I try to combine the two, with the hope of becoming an analyst for an NBA team in the future!

- In my free time I focus on analytics & viz projects centered on NBA basketball
